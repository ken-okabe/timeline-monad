https://wiki.haskell.org/FRP[Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)] integrates **time flow** and compositional events into functional programming.

The basic idea is that **a time-varying value can be represented as a function of time**.

Let's step back and review where this complexity comes from. In an attempt to model real-world phenomena, we made some apparently reasonable decisions: We modeled real-world objects with local state by computational objects with local variables. We identified time variation in the real world with time variation in the computer. We implemented the time variation of the states of the model objects in the computer with assignments to the local variables of the model objects.

Is there another approach? Can we avoid identifying time in the computer with time in the modeled world? Must we make the model change with time in order to model phenomena in a changing world? **Think about the issue in terms of mathematical functions. We can describe the time-varying behavior of a quantity  `x`  as a function of time `x(t)`. If we concentrate on  `x` instant by instant, we think of it as a changing quantity. Yet if we concentrate on the entire time history of values, we do not emphasize change -- the function itself does not change.**
(Physicists sometimes adopt this view by introducing the _world lines_ of particles as a device for reasoning about motion.)

If time is measured in discrete steps, then **we can model a time function as a (possibly infinite) sequence**. In this section, we will see **how to model change in terms of sequences that represent the time histories of the systems being modeled**. To accomplish this, we introduce new data structures called  **_streams_**. From an abstract point of view, a stream is simply a sequence. However, we will find that the straightforward implementation of streams as lists (as in section 2.2.1) doesn't fully reveal the power of stream processing. As an alternative, we introduce the technique of **_delayed evaluation_, which enables us to represent very large (even infinite) sequences as streams**.

This is really remarkable. Even though stream-withdraw implements a well-defined mathematical function whose behavior does not change, the user's perception here is one of interacting with a system that has a changing state. **One way to resolve this paradox is to realize that it is the user's temporal existence that imposes state on the system.** If the user could step back from the interaction and think in terms of streams of balances rather than individual transactions, the system would appear stateless.
(**Similarly in physics, when we observe a moving particle, we say that the position (state) of the particle is changing. However, from the perspective of the particle's _world line in space-time_ there is no change involved.**)

**we can model the world as a single, timeless, stateless unity**.

> FRP is about "datatypes that represent a value **over time**".
> Conventional imperative programming captures these dynamic values only indirectly, through state and mutations. The complete history (past, present, future) has no first class representation. Moreover, only _discretely evolving_ values can be (indirectly) captured, since the imperative paradigm is temporally discrete.
> In contrast, FRP captures these evolving values _directly_ and has no difficulty with _continuously_ evolving values.
> Dynamic/evolving values (i.e., values "over time") are first class values in themselves. You can define them and combine them, pass them into & out of functions.
