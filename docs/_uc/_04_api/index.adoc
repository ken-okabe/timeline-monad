const timeFunction = (self) ⇒ { /*…​*/ self[now] = value;};

const timeline = T( timeFunction );

const timeline1 = timeline
                         .sync( someFunction );

=== T( timeFunction )

[source,js]
----
const T: (timeFunction?: Function) => timeline
----

`T` is a function to return `timeline` object.

`timeFunction` is a function to define the `timeline` behavior with the argument `self` (`timeline` itself).

=== now

[source,js]
----
const timeFunction = (self) ⇒ { /*…​*/ self[now] = value;};
----

=== .sync( someFunction )

[source,js]
----
const timeline1 = timeline
                         .sync( someFunction );
----

`timeFunction` is executed immediately by the `T` implementation, and when `self[now] = value` is defined, the `sync` method returns a value that `someFunction` is applied to. 

[TIP]
.**timeline-monad** is extremely simple and easy to learn.
====
`T`, `now` and `sync` are all of the reserved words and units provided by the module. Once some `timeline` is created, `sync` is the only method a programmer cares.
