https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise[ES6+ Promise] is widely used in JavaScript.

Promise and timeline-monad(FRP) has a common nature to handle asynchronous behaviors in functional programming, and both has similar syntax.

In fact, **Promise is __functional__ and __reactive__. A Promise instance is a first class reactive value 'over time', so it's kind of Functional Reactive Programming(FRP)**, and the difference is in general, **FRP value reacts on repeating process, on the other hand, Promise reacts only one time**.

Hence, although FRP or __timeline__ might be a new idea to a leaner, if one already know what the Promise is, it should be straight forward to understand what the __timeline__ is.

[source,js]
.Promise and timeline-monad
----
import { T } from "timeline-monad";

let promise1resolve;
const promise1 = new Promise(resolve => { <1>
  promise1resolve = resolve;
});
const timeline1 = T(); <2>

const promise2 = promise1.then(a => a + " promise"); <3>
const timeline2 = timeline1.sync(a => a + " timeline"); <4>

const promise3 = promise2.then(a => console.log(a)); <5>
const timeline3 = timeline2.sync(a => console.log(a)); <6>

promise1resolve("hello"); <7>
timeline1.now = "hello"; <8>
----

<1> Define an empty Promise
<2> Define an empty __timeline__
<3> `promise1.then` method **returns another Promise: `promise2`** that will be resolved along with the specified function with the resolved value: `a` of `promise1`
<4> `timeline1.sync` method **returns another __timeline__: `timeline2`** that is always synchronized along with the specified function with the updated current value: `a` of `timeline1`
<5> When `promise2` is resolved, then show the value 
<6> When `timeline2` is updated, always show the value 
<7> Resolve the value of `promise1` as `"hello"`
<8> Update the current value of `timeline1` as `"hello"`

[source,shell]
.Console
----
hello promise
hello timeline
----


`Promise.then` and `timeline.sync` is like `Array.map` in the manner of delayed or asynchronously. The object method returns the object itself containing the mapped value.
 

=== Self Contained __timeline__

[source,js]
.Promise and timeline-monad
----
import { T } from "timeline-monad";

const promise = new Promise(resolve => { <1>

  const f = () => resolve("Hello promise!"); <2>
  setTimeout(f, 1000); <3>

});
const timeline = T(self => { <4>

  const f = () => (self.now = "Hello timeline!"); <5>
  setTimeout(f, 1000); <6>

});

const promise1 = promise.then(a => console.log(a)); <7>
const timeline1 = timeline.sync(a => console.log(a)); <8>
----

<1> Define `promise` and provide the resolving function: `resolve` 
<2> `resolve` the value of `promise` as `"Hello promise!"`
<3> and that will happen 1 second later
<4> Define `timeline` and provide the __timeline__ itself: `self` to update itself 
<5> Update the current value of `self` = `timeline` as `"Hello timeline!"`
<6> and that will happen 1 second later
<7> When `promise` is resolved, then show the value 
<8> When `timeline` is updated, always show the value 

[source,shell]
.Console
----
Hello promise!
Hello timeline!
----

=== Continuous updates

[source,js]
.Promise and timeline-monad
----
import { T } from "timeline-monad";

const timeline2 = T(self => {

  const f = () => (self.now = "Hello timeline!");
  setInterval(f, 1000); <1>

});

const timeline3 = timeline2.sync(a => console.log(a));
----

<1> In this code, the only difference is to use `setInterval` instead of `setTimeout`

[source,shell]
.Console
----
Hello timeline!
Hello timeline!
Hello timeline!
